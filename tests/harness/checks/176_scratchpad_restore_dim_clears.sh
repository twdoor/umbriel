# Regression for a stuck backdrop dim: restoring the last scratchpad window on an output (via
# window-toggle-scratchpad, which calls ScratchpadManager::restoreFocused) must retarget the
# backdrop fade to 0 and refresh the dim/blur nodes, same as ScratchpadManager::setVisible does
# when the scratchpad is hidden through scratchpad-toggle. Before the fix, restoreFocused and
# remove() cleared visibility without touching the backdrop fade, so the dim rect stayed at its
# last alpha forever once every scratchpad window on that output was gone.
