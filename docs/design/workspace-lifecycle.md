# Workspace lifecycle

This note records the workspace state transitions behind the shorter user guide
in [`outputs.md`](../user/outputs.md).

## Dynamic inventory

A dynamic output contains anonymous positional workspaces and may also contain
persistent named workspaces declared by `[[workspace]]`. Both use the same
runtime workspace object and stable identity. Its `named` flag controls whether
its label is explicit or generated from its current position.

The inventory maintains these invariants:

- Below the 64-workspace limit, it has a trailing empty anonymous workspace. A
  named empty workspace cannot serve as this sentinel.
- With `workspaces.empty_above` enabled, it also has a distinct leading empty
  anonymous workspace while capacity permits, including before the first view
  maps.
- Outside a workspace slide, an occupied sentinel causes Umbriel to add a new
  empty workspace at that edge when capacity remains. At the limit, the
  occupied edge persists until another slot becomes available.
- Other empty inactive anonymous workspaces are removed, except that the count
  never drops below the output's `min_workspaces`. Pruning runs from the end, so
  the surviving anonymous empties are the lowest-positioned ones.
- Named workspaces remain even when empty.
- Anonymous workspaces are renamed and all workspaces are reindexed from `1` in
  their current order. Named workspaces keep their explicit names.
- Workspace layout rules are resolved again after renumbering.

Dynamic reconciliation waits while a workspace slide is active. During the
overview it proceeds immediately and notifies the overview so its inventory can
be rebuilt.

### Reconciling configured names

For each dynamic output, the desired named members are the unscoped
`[[workspace]]` name entries plus entries whose `output` matches it. Workspace
names are case-sensitive and output-local. Output selectors retain their
ordinary case-insensitive identity matching. An unscoped name therefore
produces an independent workspace on every dynamic output.

On initial construction, named members follow declaration order near the top,
after the optional leading sentinel. On reload, Umbriel first preserves every
existing desired member by exact name. Below the output limit, newly added names
enter in declaration order at the same top insertion point. At the limit, a
name can instead claim an eligible empty anonymous workspace in place.
Reordering declarations alone does not move existing workspaces.

When a name is no longer desired on an output, Umbriel clears its `named` flag
and assigns the anonymous label for its current position. The workspace keeps
its identity and windows, then participates in normal dynamic reconciliation.
It survives while populated or active and may be pruned once empty and
inactive.

At the 64-workspace runtime limit, a missing configured name reuses an empty
anonymous workspace only when that workspace is not a leading or trailing
sentinel. Otherwise the declaration remains pending and reconciliation retries
after later workspace activity frees an ordinary anonymous entry.

## Switching interaction

A workspace slide keeps the outgoing workspace's scene enabled until the
animation finishes. Those views are render-only once their workspace becomes
inactive: pointer hit-testing must ignore them even though their buffers remain
visible. Otherwise a click during the slide can focus an outgoing window,
reactivate the workspace the user just left, and return keyboard or text-input
focus to that client.

The incoming active workspace remains interactive throughout the transition.
Pinned windows and scratchpad windows do not inherit this inactive-workspace
restriction.

## Pointer focus after scene changes

Mapping a window or activating a workspace can replace the scene under a
stationary pointer without crossing a window border. With `follows_mouse`
enabled, Umbriel does not override the mapping or workspace focus immediately.
The focus transition instead invalidates the previous hover decision once. The
next eligible pointer motion can therefore select a newly revealed view even
when both the old and new pointer coordinates fall inside it. After that one
refresh, hover returns to geometric border-crossing detection so scrolling
animations cannot cascade focus through windows moving beneath the pointer.

This distinction matters when a second window maps away from the cursor and
when returning to a workspace whose remembered focused window is elsewhere.
In both cases, a small motion inside the window under the pointer is sufficient;
the pointer does not need to leave and re-enter its border.

## Data-device drag focus

Wayland data-device drags install pointer and keyboard grabs. Normal hover
focus is suspended while the drag owns pointer motion, and keyboard enters are
suppressed until the drag finishes. When the initiating button release destroys
the grab, Umbriel reruns pointer processing at the unchanged cursor position.

With `follows_mouse` enabled, that refresh selects the window under the pointer
when it is not already focused. Activation, border state, and keyboard focus
then follow the drag target without requiring another border crossing. With
`follows_mouse` disabled, the refresh restores normal pointer delivery and the
client cursor while retaining the existing window focus.

## Static inventory

A number defines exact anonymous positions. An ordered string list defines an
exact named inventory. During a configuration reload, Umbriel preserves
workspace identity in two passes:

1. Match named entries in the new inventory by name.
2. Match any remaining entries by position.

Umbriel creates entries that have no match. When an old workspace is removed,
its windows move to the surviving workspace at the same position, or to the
last workspace when that position no longer exists. If the active workspace is
removed, that destination becomes active.

Empty static workspaces remain in the inventory. Members from a count are
anonymous and use their one-based position as a generated label. Members from
a string list are named. A `[[workspace]]` name entry changes a static member
only where its name and optional output scope match; it does not extend the
configured inventory. An unscoped rule may therefore affect matching named
static outputs while also materializing its name on dynamic outputs.

## Switching inventory type

Switching from a static inventory to dynamic workspaces keeps every populated
workspace and the active workspace. Entries whose explicit names remain
declared for the dynamic output keep those names; other members are anonymous.
Other empty anonymous workspaces are removed. The survivors are renumbered,
matching named entries are materialized, and Umbriel appends empty anonymous
workspaces until the count reaches `min_workspaces` and, while capacity permits,
the inventory ends in an empty sentinel. The optional leading empty workspace
is restored when another slot remains. At 64 occupied survivors, missing edge
sentinels wait until a slot becomes available. Switching to a static name list
uses name-first, position-second matching; switching to a count uses positions.

## Workspace layout rules

Layout settings resolve in this order:

1. Base `[layout]` settings.
2. The matching output's `layout.scrolling.default_width_fraction`.
3. A matching global `[[workspace]]` rule.
4. A matching output-specific `[[workspace]]` rule.

A name rule materializes its persistent member on a matching dynamic output and
then follows that identity. An index rule never creates a workspace and is
resolved against the current position after every inventory change. In TOML,
`name = "2"` is an explicit numeric-looking name and remains distinct from
`index = 2`.

Workspace action parsing preserves the same distinction as a typed reference.
Bare digits produce a position, ordinary text produces a name, and double
quotes force a name for numeric-looking values. Resolution never retries one
type as the other.
