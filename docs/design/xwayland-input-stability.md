# Xwayland input stability

Umbriel supports X11 clients through xwayland-satellite, which acts as both
the Wayland client owning every X11 surface and the window manager of its own
X server. Two satellite behaviors make compositor-side geometry churn
dangerous, and several Umbriel invariants exist purely to protect against
them. Breaking any of these reintroduces a bug class where an X11 game's
mouse input dies in part of the screen while everything looks correct.

## Satellite latches wl_surface.enter forever

Satellite positions each X11 window in its X coordinate space at the origin
of the output the surface last entered (`logical_position - global_min`), and
sets the surface's pointer scale from that output. `wl_surface.leave` never
reverts either one; only the next `enter` does. A single enter event for the
wrong output therefore permanently corrupts the window's X position and
pointer mapping until the surface happens to fully leave and re-enter its
real output.

wlroots emits enter/leave from scene-node visibility with a 10% overlap
threshold. Two situations cross it:

- Any window whose layout box reaches past its output: a scrolling column
  scrolled off the shared edge, an unanimated snap move that jumps a node,
  a workspace slide, a close-fade snapshot (observed: a strip snap during a
  fullscreen fight re-homed a game to the neighboring output's origin).
- Interactive drags legitimately span monitors; every boundary graze latches
  the neighbor's origin and scale mid-drag. This is accepted as inherent to
  a drag (the drop's final enter re-homes correctly), see below.

Defense:

**Per-output clipped scene roots** (`Output::viewRoot`, `fullscreenRoot`,
`pinnedRoot`, `pinnedShadowRoot`): each output owns four scene trees carrying
a `wlr_scene_tree_set_clip` of that output's layout box, and every workspace
tree, fullscreen tree, pinned view and close snapshot hangs under them.
`umbrielfx` folds an ancestor tree clip into the visibility walk
(`_scene_nodes_in_box` accumulates the clip, `scene_node_update_iterator`
intersects `node->visible` with it), so a node that reaches past its own
output has no visible region there at all: no rendering, no damage, no
membership, no enter event. There is no window position or move sequence that
can graze a neighbor, so no per-move mitigation is needed and none exists.
The drag tree is deliberately outside those roots, which is what lets a
dragged window span both outputs.

A rejected approach, for whoever considers it next: pinning scene nodes to a
single output inside `umbrielfx` (filtering `active_outputs` in
`update_node_update_outputs`) does suppress the enter/leave churn, but it
divorces output membership from rendering. `wlr_scene_output_build_state`
asserts on buffers rendered on an output they are not members of (SIGABRT
when a pinned window is dragged fully onto another output), and anything
keyed on `primary_output` (drop attribution, frame scheduling, dmabuf
feedback) silently misbehaves. Membership must stay derived from real scene
geometry, which is exactly why the clip changes that geometry instead of
filtering its result.

## X11 games can retain stale input after a windowed resize round trip

A fake-fullscreen game (borderless window at output size) that receives a
compositor-imposed windowed size, then returns to fullscreen, keeps a stale
mouse mapping: X geometry, stacking, focus, and event delivery all recover,
but hover and clicks die outside the transient size. This is upstream
Wine/satellite behavior, reproduced outside Umbriel; the boundary of the dead
zone always equals whatever transient size the compositor sent.

Umbriel therefore avoids incidental windowed resize round trips while keeping
deliberate fullscreen exits authoritative:

1. **Float toggle** (`View::setFloating(true)`) keeps the current size when
   floating a fullscreen window (no transient resize), and records
   `m_refullscreenOnTile`.
2. **Re-tile** (`View::setFloating(false)`) restores fullscreen before the
   layout attach when that flag is set, so arrange sizes the column to the
   full output the client already has. A client that chose windowed mode
   itself clears the flag (`setFullscreen(false)` from any other path) and
   re-tiles as a regular column.
3. **Fullscreen exit** (`View::setFullscreen(false)`): a tiled view clears
   fullscreen and sets its restored column size in the same client configure.
   This applies equally to native Wayland and xwayland-satellite
   views. There is no timer and no size-0x0 probe, so an X11 client that keeps
   its fullscreen-sized buffer cannot make the compositor undo the action.
   Client requests that arrive later still use the normal fullscreen request
   path.

Real migrations (dropping a window on a differently scaled output) still
resize by necessity and can still break fragile games. A deliberate
fullscreen exit followed later by fullscreen entry also necessarily crosses
a windowed size. Those are upstream constraints, not transitions the
compositor can mask without ignoring the requested state.

## Verifying changes here

The clip primitive itself is covered by
[`tests/unit/scene_clip.cpp`](../../tests/unit/scene_clip.cpp): two headless outputs, a
buffer straddling the shared edge, and assertions on the enter/leave stream,
the primary output and hit testing as the clip is set, nested, and cleared.

Compositor-level containment is covered by
[`tests/harness/checks/650_two_output_containment.sh`](../../tests/harness/checks/650_two_output_containment.sh),
which declares `# harness: outputs=2` so the harness boots it a two-output
instance, and compares real framebuffers while a strip overflows the shared
edge. Run it as `just check 650`.

The shared fullscreen-exit ordering is covered by `just check 153`: the first
windowed configure must already contain the restored tile size. The headless
harness cannot exercise satellite or multi-output X coordinate spaces, so the
X11 path still needs a running session with Steam or another X11 game. A
fullscreen exit must start the windowed resize immediately and remain windowed
after the animation settles. For the protected float and re-tile round trip,
the signature to reject is a ConfigureNotify pair through a non-fullscreen
size; a passive `StructureNotifyMask` monitor on `DISPLAY=:0` shows it directly.
