# Layer Rules

Layer rules match layer-shell surfaces such as bars, launchers, and
notifications. The `match.namespace` selector uses an ECMAScript regular
expression.

Run `umbriel layers` to list the namespaces currently in use.

```toml
[[layer_rule]]
match.namespace = "^noctalia-(bar-[^\"]+|notification|dock|panel|attached-panel|osd|desktop-widget-[^\"]*)$"
blur = true
blur_ignore_alpha = 0.5
blur_popups = true
```

## Matching

| Selector | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `match.namespace` | regex | Match the layer surface namespace. |

Regular expressions match any part of a namespace. Use `^` and `$` to match
the entire namespace. A layer surface names itself when it is created, so
`match.namespace = "^$"` selects the surfaces that named themselves with an
empty string.

## Effects

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `blur` | bool | Enable/disable blur for the layer surface. |
| `blur_popups` | bool | Enable/disable blur for descendant XDG popups. |
| `blur_ignore_alpha` | float | Skip blur where surface alpha is below this threshold (0.0-1.0). `0.0` blurs the entire rectangle; higher values leave transparent regions unblurred. |
| `blur_optimized` | bool | Override `appearance.blur.optimized`. A `true` value keeps the cached background blur alive on every output even when the global switch is off. |

Layer-shell blur is off by default. As with window rules, every matching rule
contributes its settings, and later values take precedence. Rules from included
files come before the rules in the file that includes them.
