# Window Rules

Window rules can match `app_id`, title, and a client-defined XDG toplevel tag
using ECMAScript regular expressions. They can also match a standardized
content type or focus state. Every matching rule contributes its settings. If
two rules set the same field, the rule that appears later in the file takes
precedence.

```toml
[[window_rule]]
match.app_id = "firefox"
match.title = "^Library$"
default_floating = true
```

## Matching

| Selector | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `match.app_id` | regex | Match the window's app ID. |
| `match.title` | regex | Match the window's title. |
| `match.xdg_tag` | regex | Match the client-defined XDG toplevel tag. |
| `match.content_type` | string | Match `"none"`, `"photo"`, `"video"`, or `"game"`. |
| `match.is_focused` | bool | Match the window's focused state dynamically. |
| `match.at_startup` | bool | Match `true` during the first 60 seconds after starting umbriel and `false` afterward. |

Every selector is optional. A rule without selectors matches every window.
Regular expressions match any part of a value by default. Use `^` and `$` when
you need to match the entire value.

A selector only matches a value the client actually set. A client that never set
an app ID, a title, or a tag matches no pattern for it, while one that set an
empty string matches a pattern that accepts the empty string. `match.title =
"^$"` therefore selects windows whose title is empty, such as Firefox's browser
toolbox, and never selects windows that are simply waiting to be titled.

Run `umbriel windows` to inspect open windows. Its human-readable output adds
suffixes such as `[xdg_tag=proton-game]` and `[content_type=game]` when those
values are present. The JSON form, `umbriel windows --json`, always reports
`xdg_tag` and `content_type`, and also includes the `xwayland` boolean and the
client `pid` described in [IPC](ipc.md#queries).

An XDG toplevel tag is one client-defined string, not a fixed vocabulary. A
client can set it before the window opens and replace it later if the window's
purpose changes. The initial tag participates in opening settings. Later
replacements refresh settings from the dynamic table below, but never replay
opening settings. Windows with no tag do not match an `xdg_tag` selector; a
client that tagged itself with an empty string matches `"^$"`.

Umbriel derives a window's content type from standardized Wayland hints on its
XDG root surface and visible subsurfaces. When those hints differ, it uses the
priority `game`, `video`, `photo`, then `none`. This also covers Proton and Wine
games that publish the hint on a child surface. `none` includes windows that do
not publish a content hint. Client changes refresh settings from the dynamic
table below, but never replay the opening settings.

## Settings applied when a window opens

These settings are applied once when the window opens. Some applications set
their title shortly afterward, so Umbriel checks the rules one more time when
that first title arrives. Only newly resolved settings are applied: unchanged
opening settings do not overwrite user changes made in the meantime.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `default_output` | string | Open on a specific output (e.g. `"DP-1"`). |
| `default_workspace` | int | Place on workspace N from 1 to 64. On dynamic outputs, values beyond the current count clamp to the last workspace. |
| `default_fullscreen` | bool | Open fullscreen across the entire output, ignoring layout struts and layer-shell exclusive zones. |
| `default_floating` | bool | Force floating (`true`) or force tiling (`false`). |
| `default_maximize` | bool | Open maximized. A tiled column still respects layout struts and gaps. Parented transient dialogs keep their natural size. |
| `default_maximize_to_edges` | bool | Explicitly open maximized to edges. The initial configure fills the usable area without layout struts, gaps, or borders, so the window does not open at its normal size first. Layer-shell exclusive zones stay visible. Takes precedence over `default_maximize`; when combined with `default_fullscreen` the window opens fullscreen and returns to maximized to edges once fullscreen is cleared. |
| `default_focused` | bool | Take focus when opening, switching to the window's workspace when needed. Defaults to `true`; set to `false` to preserve the existing focus and workspace. |
| `default_pinned` | bool | Open pinned above regular windows and keep the window visible across workspace changes. Pinning makes a tiled window floating. |
| `default_size` | `[w,h]` | Initial size in pixels, clamped to the client's min/max hints. Floats use both, then own their size and honor client resizes. A new tiled column in a horizontal scrolling layout uses the width and ignores the height; vertical scrolling, dwindle, and master use their layout geometry. Takes precedence over `default_width`/`default_height` when set. |
| `default_width` | float | Initial extent as a fraction (0.1-1.0): usable-area width for floating windows, or scrolling-axis extent for tiled windows in the scrolling layout. Overrides `layout.scrolling.default_width_fraction`; ignored by tiled windows in dwindle and master. |
| `default_height` | float | Floating windows only, on the same terms as `default_width`. Initial height as a fraction (0.1-1.0) of the usable area. Ignored for tiled windows. |
| `default_position` | table | Floating windows only, initial position: `{ x = int, y = int, anchor = string }`. Ignored for tiled windows. |
| `default_scrolling_column` | string | Scrolling windows only. Place windows with the same non-empty name in one column. Floating windows and other layout modes ignore it. |
| `default_scrolling_column_order` | int | Scrolling windows only. Position within `default_scrolling_column`, independent of launch timing. Lower values open higher in horizontal scrolling and farther left in vertical scrolling. Windows without an order follow ordered windows. |

For tiled windows, `default_maximize` expands the column to the full width
inside configured struts and gaps; for floating windows, it fills the usable
area. Client maximize requests made before the window maps are honored only when
`general.honor_restored_maximize` is enabled. Requests after mapping are always
honored.

Scrolling extents are gap-aware, so lanes whose fractions sum to `1` exactly
fill the viewport. A vertical strip applies the fraction to lane height. For a
new horizontal column, a matching `default_size` width takes
precedence over `default_width` and the configured scrolling default. Existing
named columns keep their established width. The pixel width seeds a fraction of
the opening viewport, and moving the lane within or between scrolling
workspaces retains its current fraction.

If neither `default_width` nor a matching
`layout.scrolling.default_width_fraction` is set, a scrolling window chooses
its initial logical extent.

Without `default_output`, a numbered workspace owned by exactly one fixed output
inventory also selects that output. For example, if only `DP-1` has a fourth
configured workspace, `default_workspace = 4` opens there even when the window
was launched from another output. If several fixed outputs contain that
position, Umbriel keeps the launch output. An explicit `default_output` always
scopes the workspace lookup to that output.

## Floating position

`default_position` only affects floating windows. Coordinates are logical pixels
within the output's usable area, so panels and other exclusive zones are taken
into account.

The packaged config floats browser windows titled `Picture-in-Picture` or
`Picture in picture` and places them 20 logical pixels from the bottom-right
corner. XDG shell has no semantic PiP role and does not let clients choose a
global window position, so this behavior is implemented as a title rule.

For example, this opens a window 32 pixels right and 24 pixels up from the
bottom-left corner:

```toml
[[window_rule]]
match.app_id = "^org[.]example[.]Utility$"
default_floating = true
default_size = [800, 600]
default_position = { x = 32, y = 24, anchor = "bottom_left" }
```

Floating windows can instead be sized as fractions of the usable area, per
axis. `default_size` (pixels) wins when both are set:

```toml
[[window_rule]]
match.app_id = "^org[.]example[.]Utility$"
default_floating = true
default_width = 0.5
default_height = 0.6
```

`anchor` defaults to `"center"`, so this centers a floating window exactly:

```toml
default_position = { x = 0, y = 0 }
```

Available anchors are `"center"`, `"top_left"`, `"top_right"`,
`"bottom_left"`, `"bottom_right"`, `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, and
`"right"`. Right anchors measure `x` leftward from the right edge; bottom
anchors measure `y` upward from the bottom edge. The single-edge anchors center
the window on the other axis. Umbriel keeps part of the window visible if an
offset would otherwise place it completely off-screen.

## Floating size

`default_size` sizes a float in pixels. `default_width` and `default_height`
size it as fractions of the output's usable area instead, so one rule suits any
monitor. The axes are independent: an axis without a fraction keeps the size the
client asked for. Both are clamped to the client's min/max hints.

```toml
[[window_rule]]
match.app_id = "^org[.]example[.]Utility$"
default_floating = true
default_width = 0.5
default_height = 0.6
```

`default_size` wins on both axes when it is set as well.

Fractions reach every floating window the rule matches, not only windows the
rule floats with `default_floating`. A window that floats because it declares a
parent, such as a dialog, or because it fixes its size through min/max hints,
takes the fraction too. Dialogs usually share their application's `app_id`, so a
`default_width` written for scrolling lane widths also sizes that application's
dialogs. Match on `title` or `xdg_tag` to keep a rule off them.

## Named scrolling columns

Assign the same `default_scrolling_column` to applications that should share a
scrolling column. The first matching window opens a column. Later matches on the
same workspace join it.

```toml
[[window_rule]]
match.app_id = "^firefox$"
default_scrolling_column = "browsers"
default_scrolling_column_order = 10

[[window_rule]]
match.app_id = "^chromium$"
default_scrolling_column = "browsers"
default_scrolling_column_order = 20
```

The name is local to a workspace. If a named scrolling column has been split manually,
new windows join the first column containing that name. The first window also
sets the column width. `default_scrolling_column_order` has no effect without
`default_scrolling_column`.

## Settings updated while a window is open

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `opacity` | float | Surface opacity (0.0-1.0). The rule is bypassed while the window is fullscreen and resumes after it leaves fullscreen; client-provided alpha remains active. With blur enabled, the translucent surface reveals a full-strength blurred backdrop, matching equivalent alpha supplied by the client. |
| `blur` | bool | Enable/disable blur for this window. |
| `blur_popups` | bool | Enable/disable blur for its XDG popups. |
| `blur_ignore_alpha` | float | Skip blur where surface alpha is below this threshold (0.0-1.0). Applies to the window and its popups. |
| `blur_optimized` | bool | Override `appearance.blur.optimized` for this window. A `true` value keeps the cached background blur alive on every output even when the global switch is off. |
| `focus_on_activate` | bool | Override `general.focus_on_activate` for activation requests targeting this window, including trusted launch tokens. `false` vetoes trusted activation focus and marks an otherwise unfocused target urgent. An untrusted request cannot suppress the window's normal `default_focused` map behavior. |
| `vrr` | string | Override the focused window's output VRR policy: `"disabled"`, `"always"`, or `"fullscreen"`. Without this key, the output's configured `vrr` policy applies. |
| `tearing` | bool | Override the client's tearing hint. Omit it to follow the hint, set `true` to request asynchronous presentation, or set `false` to veto it. The output must still opt in with `tearing = true`, and the window must be fullscreen. |
| `hdr` | string | Override the focused window's output HDR policy: `"off"`, `"on"`, `"auto"`, or `"fullscreen"`. Without this key, the output's configured `hdr` policy applies. This does not assign HDR metadata to the surface. |
