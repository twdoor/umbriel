# Actions

Actions are the compositor's verbs. Bind one under `[keybinds]`, attach it to a
[hot corner](keybinds.md#hot-corners), or run it with `umbriel msg <action>`.
`umbriel msg --help` prints this same list, with the same wording and the same
grouping. See [Keybinds](keybinds.md) for chord syntax and [IPC](ipc.md) for the
socket behind `umbriel msg`, including the event stream that reports what an
action changed.

## Argument forms

An action takes at most one argument, appended after a colon. `<angle>` forms
are required, `[bracket]` forms are optional.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `<cmd>` | Command line, run through the shell: `spawn:kitty` |
| `<name>` | Submap to enter; `submap:reset` leaves one level |
| `<workspace>[/<output>]` | Workspace name or 1-based position, optionally qualified by output: `workspace-switch:CHAT/HDMI-A-1` |
| `<window-id>` | Window id from `umbriel windows` |
| `[<window-id>]` | The same id; the bare action targets the focused window |
| `[<output>]` | Connector or monitor name. Bare `dpms-off` and `dpms-on` target every configured output |
| `[<scratchpad>]` | Scratchpad name. The bare form selects the implicit `default` scratchpad, which exists only when no named scratchpads are configured |
| `<fraction>` | `0.1` to `1.0` of the column extent, or of the usable area for a floating window |
| `<delta>` | Signed `-0.9` to `0.9`; the result clamps to `0.1` to `1.0` |
| `<scrolling\|dwindle\|master\|toggle>` | Layout mode for `workspace-set-layout`; `toggle` cycles scrolling, dwindle, master |
| `[skip-confirmation]` | `session-quit` only: quit without the on-screen confirmation |

## Layout differences

Column-scoped actions operate on the active layout's column projection,
described in [Layouts](layout.md). Where that projection changes what an action
does, this is the full list:

| Action | Scrolling | Dwindle | Master |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| `column-move-left`, `column-move-right` | Reorders the focused column | Swaps the focused window with the neighboring tile | Exchanges the master and stack contents, and does nothing while either area is empty |
| `column-move-to-first`, `column-move-to-last` | Moves the column to that end of the workspace | Swaps the focused window with the first or last tile | Exchanges master and stack unless the focused area is already first or last |
| `window-consume-left`, `window-consume-right` | Stacks the window into the adjacent column | Swaps with the adjacent on-screen tile in that direction | Moves the window between the master and stack areas |
| `window-consume-or-expel-left`, `window-consume-or-expel-right` | Splits a stacked window into its own column, or stacks a lone window into the adjacent one | Swaps with the adjacent on-screen tile in that direction | Moves the window between the master and stack areas |
| `window-set-height`, `window-modify-height`, `window-cycle-height`, `window-cycle-height-back` | Sizes the row within its column | Adjusts the vertical splits containing the window | Sizes the row within the master or stack area |
| `column-center` | Centers the column in the viewport | Returns an IPC error | Returns an IPC error |
| `layout-scroll-left`, `layout-scroll-right`, `layout-scroll-up`, `layout-scroll-down`, `layout-scroll-drag` | Pans the strip | No effect | No effect |
| `layout-master-count-increase`, `layout-master-count-decrease` | No effect | No effect | Moves one window between master and stack |

Dwindle and master have no horizontal viewport, so the vertical splits and areas
absorb what scrolling would express as column geometry. On an output with
horizontal workspaces the strip is vertical and the directional actions follow
their visual directions; see [Vertical strips](layout.md#vertical-strips).

## Notes

- **Launch tokens.** `spawn:` exports a one-shot `XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN` and a
  matching `DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID` to the command. A single-instance application
  can pass that token to its existing window so Umbriel reveals it, including
  when the window remaps after hiding in a tray. Startup commands from
  `general.autostart` receive no launch token.
- **Quitting.** Bare `session-quit` opens an on-screen confirmation: Enter or
  the quit bind confirms, any other key or a click cancels, and a second
  `session-quit` also quits. While the session is locked it quits without the
  dialog.
- **Cursor.** With `input.cursor.follows_focus` enabled, focus navigation and
  window or column transfers between workspaces warp the cursor to the visible
  center of the focused window. This includes local `window-move-or-output-*`
  moves, transfers to another output, output focus actions, and foreign-
  toplevel activation requests from docks and taskbars. Pointer-driven and
  automatic focus changes never move the cursor. `window-focus:<window-id>`
  stays focus-only, while `window-focus-warp:<window-id>` always moves it.
- **Across outputs.** Directions never wrap: with no monitor in that direction
  the action fails with an IPC error naming it ("no output to the left" and
  friends). Otherwise the cursor warps to the center of the target monitor so
  focus follows the action. With `input.cursor.follows_focus` enabled, it then
  settles on the focused window's visible center when the target workspace has
  one. A moved window or column uses that same target. Output direction comes
  from output centers in logical coordinates, so fractional-scale rounding does
  not hide a neighbor.
- **Cycling.** `window-focus-next` and `window-focus-previous` walk the tiled
  windows in layout order, then the floating ones, wrapping in both directions.
  `window-swap-next` and `window-swap-previous` exchange the focused tiled
  window with its layout-order neighbor, wrap at both ends, and keep focus on
  the moved window.
- **Workspace order.** `workspace-next`, `workspace-previous`, `workspace-move-
  up`, and `workspace-move-down` never wrap: on the first workspace, the
  previous forms are silent no-ops. On a dynamic output, `workspace-next`
  reaches the trailing empty workspace, which becomes active as usual.
- **Columns as a unit.** A whole-column move preserves member order, the column
  width, its full-width restore value, and stacked row proportions. In master
  layout it transfers every member of the focused master or stack area. A column
  moved onto a dwindle workspace flattens into single-window columns. With a
  floating window focused there is no column, so the destination-moving column
  actions act like their window counterparts.
- **Floating and pinned.** `window-toggle-floating` remembers the window's
  floating size and position; the first time a window floats, Umbriel places it
  slightly below and to the right of its tiled position while keeping it on-
  screen. `window-toggle-pinned` floats the window and keeps it above fullscreen
  windows on its output, visible across workspace switches and hidden for as
  long as the overview is open. A fullscreen window cannot be pinned, and making
  a pinned window fullscreen drops the pin.
- **Unavailable actions.** When an action has no meaning in the active layout,
  its keybind does nothing and `umbriel msg` returns an error naming the
  requirement.
