# Configuration

Without `-c`, Umbriel checks `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/umbriel/config.toml` first,
followed by each `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/umbriel/config.toml`, then the packaged
`share/umbriel/config.toml`. The candidate paths come from the startup
environment and remain watched for the session. Creating a higher-priority
file or removing the current file re-evaluates the lookup without a restart.
Removal selects the next existing file, or built-in defaults when none remain.

An invalid higher-priority file does not fall through to a lower-priority one.
Umbriel keeps the last working configuration until the file is corrected or
removed. Pass `umbriel -c <path>` to pin one exact path instead of using the
lookup chain. A missing or invalid pinned path never falls back to an implicit
candidate. Umbriel does not create or modify a user config automatically.

At startup, a missing explicit `-c` path, syntax errors, unreadable files, and
invalid include directives are fatal. Other invalid settings fall back to
defaults unless `[drm]` is configured.

## Starting configuration

The packaged starting configuration is
[`examples/config.toml`](../../examples/config.toml). Distribution packages
normally install it under `/usr/share/umbriel/config.toml`. Copy it before
making local changes:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/umbriel
cp /usr/share/umbriel/config.toml ~/.config/umbriel/config.toml
```

With a manual installation using the `/usr/local` prefix, the default example
configuration is available at `/usr/local/share/umbriel/config.toml`. Nix users
should prefer `programs.umbriel.settings` in Home Manager or hjem.

Creating the user file while Umbriel is running applies it automatically, as
do later saves. No logout or restart is needed. If a reload fails, Umbriel
keeps your last working configuration and continues watching the failed
candidate and its included files. Save a corrected file to try the reload
again. Options that require a restart are marked in their reference tables.

A successful reload keeps the current keyboard focus when its window or
keyboard-interactive layer remains mapped, visible, and on an enabled output.
If that owner is no longer usable, Umbriel selects the active workspace on the
pointer output instead.

## Diagnostics

Warnings and errors from a load or reload appear in a panel at the top of the
primary output, bordered in `colors.warning` or `colors.error` for the highest
severity present. Errors are listed first, since they are the ones that kept the
configuration from applying. Each entry names its file, line, and column.

A panel that reports only warnings hides itself after ten seconds; one that
reports an error stays until the next successful reload. At most six entries are
listed, and the footer counts the rest. `umbriel validate` prints the full list
without a running compositor and exits nonzero when it reports a diagnostic.

## Include

```toml
[include]
files = [
    "appearance.toml",
    "keybinds.toml",
]

[include.optional]
files = [
    "~/.config/umbriel/noctalia.toml",
]
```

Paths are resolved relative to the file that declares them. `~` and `~/`
expand to the user's home directory. `$VAR` and `${VAR}` expand environment
variables.

Missing files in `[include.optional]` are silently ignored and remain watched
unless the main file declares `[drm]`. Creating a non-DRM optional file applies
it without a restart. An optional file that exists must contain valid TOML.

Files in `[include]` are applied in list order, followed by files in
`[include.optional]`. Values in the including file override every include.

`[include]` accepts `files` and the `optional` sub-table.
`[include.optional]` accepts only `files`. Unknown keys and invalid types reject
both main and included configurations.

If an included file defines `[drm]`, add an empty `[drm]` table to the main
file. Umbriel then rejects a missing required or optional include instead of
applying an incomplete exclusion list.

You can split your config into multiple files for clarity:

```toml
# ~/.config/umbriel/config.toml
[include]
files = [
  "src/general.toml",
  "src/appearance.toml",
  "src/input.toml",
  "src/keybinds.toml",
  "src/rules.toml",
  "src/workspaces.toml",
  "machines/monolith.toml",
]
```

## General
`general.xwayland = true` provides X11 application support through the
`xwayland-satellite` executable. Install `xwayland-satellite` and make sure it
is on `PATH` before starting Umbriel. If it is unavailable, X11 applications
will not work and Umbriel shows a startup warning. Set `xwayland = false` when
X11 support is not needed.

```toml
[general]
autostart = ["noctalia", "kitty"]
mod_key = "Super"
xwayland = true
show_cheatsheet = true
focus_on_activate = false
honor_restored_maximize = false
```

Later maximize requests are always honored. Applies to newly opened windows. |

## DRM devices

Use the optional `[drm]` section to keep GPUs unopened in a native session.
Omit it to retain automatic GPU discovery. Changes require a restart.

```toml
[drm]
ignored_pci_addresses = ["0000:01:00.0"]
# Alternative using a stable DRM path:
# ignored_devices = ["/dev/dri/by-path/pci-0000:01:00.0-card"]
```

| Key                     | Type         | Default | Description |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `ignored_devices`       | string array | `[]`    | Absolute DRM card or render-node paths that resolve at startup. Either node excludes the whole GPU. |
| `ignored_pci_addresses` | string array | `[]`    | PCI addresses in `domain:bus:slot.function` form. Use this when the GPU may start bound to `vfio-pci`. |

Prefer stable `/dev/dri/by-path` links over numbered `cardN` and `renderDN`
paths. Each path resolves once at startup and pins that GPU for the session,
even if the path disappears, changes target, or gets reused. Startup rejects
unresolved paths with guidance to use `ignored_pci_addresses` instead.

Umbriel does not bind or unbind PCI drivers. Configure libvirt with managed
host devices, or use equivalent host tooling, for that lifecycle.

### Limits

- The section has no effect on nested Wayland, X11, or headless backends.
- A native session fails to start if the build lacks the wlroots DRM backend or libudev.
- Startup fails if no allowed GPU works. Losing the primary GPU ends the session.
- Secondary GPUs must support the primary GPU's DMA-BUF format and modifiers.
- `WLR_RENDERER_FORCE_SOFTWARE=1` is incompatible with exclusions.
- Exclusions override `WLR_DRM_DEVICES` and `WLR_RENDER_DRM_DEVICE`.
- With exclusions, `WLR_BACKENDS` supports only `drm` and optional `libinput`.

See [DRM GPU exclusion](../design/drm-device-policy.md) for the backend and
renderer design.

## Environment

```toml
[environment]
GTK_THEME = "Adwaita:dark"
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME = "qt5ct"
```

Umbriel exports these variables to itself and commands it starts. In a native
session, it also publishes them to the systemd user manager before
`umbriel-session.target` starts. Systemd session services such as Noctalia
inherit the same values, as do applications they launch. D-Bus receives the
graphical connection variables but not arbitrary configured variables, because
they are intended for systemd-managed session services. A nested Umbriel session
does not modify the host session environment. Without a reachable systemd user
manager, the values still apply to Umbriel and commands it starts directly.

Published values remain in the systemd user manager until it exits or another
process changes them. After removing a key from the config, run
`systemctl --user unset-environment NAME` to remove its previous manager value,
or wait until the user manager exits.

Names must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`, and all values must be strings. This
section cannot override `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_SOCKET`, `DISPLAY`,
`UMBRIEL_SOCKET`, `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, `XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP`, or
`XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, which Umbriel owns. It is applied only at startup. Config
reload does not update environments already captured by running processes.
Restart Umbriel after changing it, then fully quit and relaunch long-running
applications such as Steam if they survived the session restart.

## Events

```toml
[events]
lid_close = "notify-send 'The laptop lid is closed!'"
lid_open = "notify-send 'The laptop lid is open!'"
```

Defines commands that are executed when the laptop lid is closed or opened.

## Scratchpads

With no `[[scratchpad]]` entries, Umbriel provides one implicit scratchpad
named `default`. Bare scratchpad actions select it:

```toml
[keybinds]
"Mod+Shift+Space" = "window-move-to-scratchpad"
"Mod+Space" = "scratchpad-toggle"
```

To use multiple scratchpads, define each name and include that name in every
scratchpad action:

```toml
[[scratchpad]]
name = "terminal"

[[scratchpad]]
name = "music"

[keybinds]
"Mod+Shift+Space" = "window-toggle-scratchpad:terminal"
"Mod+Space" = "scratchpad-toggle:terminal"
"Mod+Shift+M" = "window-toggle-scratchpad:music"
"Mod+M" = "scratchpad-toggle:music"
```

Defining any named scratchpad removes the implicit `default` scratchpad, so
bare scratchpad actions are invalid in named mode. Names must be nonempty and
unique. The name `default` is reserved and cannot appear in a
`[[scratchpad]]` entry.

Scratchpads are global and roam between outputs. Each stored window keeps its
own restore output and workspace. Removing a scratchpad definition during a
config reload restores its windows to those saved destinations.

See [Scratchpads](scratchpad.md) for action behavior, focus, dragging, and
multi-output details.

## Idle inhibition

Umbriel supports application idle inhibitors and idle notifications. An
application inhibits screen blanking, locking, and other idle actions only
while its associated surface is mapped and visible. Switching away from its
workspace, hiding a scratchpad window, disabling its output, or locking the
session stops honoring that inhibitor until the surface becomes visible
again. A visible lock surface may provide its own inhibitor while the session
is locked.
