# Input

Configure keyboard, pointer, touchpad, tablet, cursor, and focus behavior in one
place.

## Settings

```toml
[input]
middle_click_paste = false
window_drag_toggle = "none"
```

`middle_click_paste` controls the primary-selection clipboard. It defaults to
`true`. Set it to `false` to disable pasting selected text with a middle click
from either a mouse or touchpad. This also disables other primary-selection
paste methods such as Shift+Insert, while the regular clipboard used by Ctrl+C
and Ctrl+V remains available.

When disabled, Umbriel clears the current primary selection and rejects new
primary selections from connected clients. Applications started while it is
disabled are not offered the primary-selection protocol. The setting applies
immediately on config reload, but protocol visibility is fixed when an
application connects. Applications started while it was disabled must be
restarted after re-enabling it.

`window_drag_toggle` retargets a window drag in progress: while a window is held
with one mouse button, a press of the other main button changes where the drag
will put it. It defaults to `none`, which leaves the drag alone. `floating`
switches between the tiled layout and floating. `pinned` switches pinning on and
off; turning it off puts the window back in the tiled layout when that is where
it was pinned from, and leaves it floating otherwise.

The window's state changes when the drag drops, not when the button is pressed,
so a drag can be retargeted as often as needed and toggling back and forth
returns the window to the column width it was dragged out of. A drop that floats
the window restores its remembered floating size, and the pointer keeps its grip
on the same part of the window across that resize. A window that cannot take the
target state (a fullscreen window cannot be pinned) drops where it was.

### Keyboard

```toml
[input.keyboard]
layout = ""       # XKB layout, empty = system default
variant = ""      # XKB variant
options = ""      # XKB options, comma-separated
repeat_rate = 25  # 0-1000 Hz, 0 disables
repeat_delay = 600 # 0-10000 ms
numlock_toggle = true # true enables NumLock when a keyboard connects; false leaves it off
track_layout = "global" # "global", or "window" to track the layout per surface
```

These settings apply to physical keyboards. Virtual keyboard clients provide
their own XKB keymaps, and Umbriel attaches each device to the seat only after
its first usable keymap is ready. Applications therefore never receive the
temporary empty keymap from a virtual keyboard that is still initializing.

`layout` takes a comma-separated list to load several layouts at once
(`layout = "us,de"`, optionally with a matching `variant = ",nodeadkeys"`). The
first entry is active at startup. Switch between them with the
`keyboard-layout-next` keybind or `umbriel msg keyboard-layout-next`, or put a
toggle in `options`:

```toml
[input.keyboard]
layout = "us,de"
options = "grp:alt_shift_toggle"
```

Physical keyboards that share a named layout stay on that layout together,
whether the change comes from an XKB toggle or `keyboard-layout-next`. Device
overrides may list layouts in a different order: Umbriel matches them by XKB
name, and leaves a keyboard unchanged when it does not provide the selected
layout. IPC reports the layout vocabulary of the keyboard that most recently
changed groups. Connecting another keyboard adopts that selected layout when
available and does not reset the existing keyboards.

Run `umbriel keyboard-layouts` to list the layouts reported by that keyboard.
The active layout is prefixed with `*`. Use `umbriel keyboard-layouts --json`
for the same names and a zero-based `current_index` in structured output.

`options` is passed to XKB verbatim, so anything `xkbcli list` reports under
options works (`grp:win_space_toggle`, `caps:escape`, `compose:ralt`, …). An
`options` value XKB does not recognize is ignored silently, the same as with
`setxkbmap`; a `layout` or `variant` that fails to compile is reported in the
log and the whole keyboard block falls back to the system default.

#### Layout switching

`keyboard-layout-next` advances one physical keyboard to its next configured
layout and synchronizes that named layout to physical keyboards that also
provide it. The action wraps at the source keyboard's final layout, is inert
when no physical keyboard provides multiple layouts, and never changes a
virtual keyboard's client-owned keymap.

```toml
[input.keyboard]
layout = "us,de"

[keybinds]
"Mod+Shift+K" = "keyboard-layout-next"
```

`umbriel msg keyboard-layout-next` does the same from a script or panel. An XKB
toggle such as `options = "grp:alt_shift_toggle"` is an alternative that lives
in the keymap itself, and the two can coexist.

#### Tracking the layout per window

With several layouts loaded, `track_layout` decides how far a layout change
reaches.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"global"` | A layout change applies to the whole session. This is the default. |
| `"window"` | Each surface keeps its own layout. |

Under `"window"`, the named layout in use when a surface loses focus is stored
against that surface and restored when it regains focus. Matching by XKB name
keeps device overrides with differently ordered layout lists consistent. A
surface that has not been focused before starts from the canonical keyboard's
first layout, so it does not inherit the layout of the previous surface.

The unit here is the surface, not the window, so layer-shell clients are covered
too. Opening a launcher while a window using the second layout is focused gives
the new launcher the first layout. Closing it returns focus, and its remembered
layout, to the window. Reloading input configuration rebuilds the physical
keymaps and clears remembered surface layouts.

This matters most when the layouts share nothing. Two Latin layouts differ by a
few keys, but a Latin and a non-Latin layout share no characters at all, so
writing in one application and typing commands in another means switching on
every single change of focus unless the compositor remembers.

### Touchpad

```toml
[input.touchpad]
tap = true
natural_scroll = true
# accel_profile = "adaptive"  # "flat", "adaptive", or a custom curve
# sensitivity = 0.5           # -1.0 to 1.0
# scroll_factor = 1.5         # touchpad scroll speed, 0.1 to 10.0
# disable_while_typing = true
# disable_on_external_mouse = true
# click_method = "clickfinger"  # "button_areas" or "clickfinger"
```

Tap-to-click is enabled by default. Set `tap = false` to disable it globally,
or use a per-device override below. `natural_scroll` and
`disable_while_typing` remain unset by default, which preserves each device's
corresponding libinput default. Set `disable_while_typing = false` to keep the
touchpad active while typing. Removing either optional setting on reload
restores the device default. Options are applied only when supported by the
device; an explicitly configured unsupported option is reported in the log.

The effective `natural_scroll` value also controls Umbriel's three-finger
gestures: horizontal strip scrolling, vertical workspace switching, and
workspace selection while the overview is open. A per-device override or
preserved libinput default applies to gestures from that device. The
four-finger overview open and close gesture keeps its fixed direction.

`accel_profile` and `sensitivity` work like their `[input.mouse]` counterparts,
including custom curves. Both remain unset by default, which uses each
touchpad's libinput default profile and speed. Removing either setting on reload
restores the corresponding default. `sensitivity` alone adjusts pointer speed
under the device's default profile.

`click_method` decides how a physical press becomes a button. `button_areas`
splits the bottom of the pad into left, middle, and right zones, while
`clickfinger` reads the finger count instead: one finger is a left click, two a
right click, three a middle click, anywhere on the pad. It is unset by default,
which keeps each device's libinput default, and removing it on reload restores
that default. Clickpads that only expose software buttons support just
`button_areas`; asking for `clickfinger` there is reported in the log and leaves
the device alone.

`scroll_factor` multiplies the smooth two-finger scroll a touchpad sends to the
focused window, so `2.0` scrolls twice as fast and `0.5` half as fast. It
remains unset by default (identity, `1.0`) and takes the next scroll event on
reload. It applies only to the continuous scroll delta: discrete notches,
overview wheel stepping, and three-finger-swipe strip travel keep their own
counting semantics.

Set `disable_on_external_mouse = true` to disable the touchpad while an
external mouse is connected. Libinput re-enables it automatically once the
mouse is unplugged. Detection is handled by libinput itself, so this only
works in a native session because a nested session has no libinput devices to
configure. Unlike `tap` and `disable_while_typing`, this option has no
`[[input.device]]` per-device override. If a device doesn't support the mode,
an explicitly configured value is ignored and a warning is logged; removing
the key on reload restores the device's default.

### Mouse

```toml
[input.mouse]
natural_scroll = false
# accel_profile = "flat"  # "flat", "adaptive", or a custom curve
sensitivity = 0.0        # -1.0 to 1.0
scroll_wheel_step = 60  # 1-1000, pixels per step for layout-scroll-left/right
# scroll_button = "MouseBack"       # Hold this button and move the mouse to scroll
# scroll_button_lock = false        # One press latches scrolling instead of holding
```

Omitting `accel_profile` preserves each device's libinput default, which is
usually `adaptive` for a mouse. Set `accel_profile = "flat"` to disable
speed-dependent acceleration, or set it to `adaptive` explicitly to override a
different device default. `sensitivity` controls pointer speed independently of
the selected profile. A custom curve can be supplied with this syntax:

```toml
accel_profile = "custom 0.2 0.0 0.5 1.0 2.0"
```

The first number is the positive input-speed step, followed by at least two
non-negative output-speed points. Libinput interpolates between them.
`sensitivity` has no effect when a custom profile is selected. Omit
`natural_scroll` or `accel_profile` to preserve each device's corresponding
libinput default. `layout-scroll-left` and `layout-scroll-right` clamp to the
strip bounds, so the columns never park
past either edge. Wheel-triggered scrolling uses twice `scroll_wheel_step`
during an active tiled window drag.

`scroll_button` hands one button to libinput as a scroll modifier: while it is
held, pointer motion scrolls the surface under the cursor instead of moving the
cursor, and that motion consumes the button rather than clicking. Pressing and
releasing it without moving the pointer still clicks, so the button keeps
working for plain clicks and a bind on it still fires in that case, which is
what the load-time log line means. It takes the same names as a mouse keybind,
`MouseLeft`, `MouseRight`, `MouseMiddle`, `MouseBack`, or `MouseForward`.
`scroll_button_lock = true` latches instead: one press starts scrolling, the
next stops it, which suits a side button that is awkward to hold. Both keys are
unset by default and removing them restores the device's libinput default. A
device that cannot do button scrolling, or that has no such button, is reported
in the log and left alone.

`[input.mouse]` reaches every pointer that is not a touchpad. A touchpad takes
a scroll button only from its own `[[input.device]]` rule, because a touchpad
can run one scroll method at a time and button scrolling would cost it
two-finger scrolling.

### Per-device overrides

Use `[[input.device]]` to override settings for devices whose name exactly
matches `name`. Matching is case-sensitive. The name is the `Device` value
reported by `libinput list-devices`.

```toml
[[input.device]]
name = "Acme Split Keyboard"
layout = "us"
variant = "colemak_dh"
repeat_rate = 40
repeat_delay = 250

[[input.device]]
name = "Acme Precision Touchpad"
tap = true
natural_scroll = false
accel_profile = "flat"
sensitivity = 0.0
disable_while_typing = false
click_method = "clickfinger"

[[input.device]]
name = "Acme Gaming Mouse"
accel_profile = "flat"
sensitivity = 0.0
scroll_button = "MouseBack"
scroll_button_lock = false
```

Each rule inherits the matching class settings and overrides only the keys it
contains. `layout`, `variant`, `options`, `repeat_rate`, and `repeat_delay`
apply to keyboards. `tap`, `disable_while_typing`, and `click_method` apply to
touchpads. `natural_scroll` applies to touchpads and mice. `scroll_button` and
`scroll_button_lock` apply to any pointer, including a touchpad, which reads
them nowhere else. `accel_profile` and `sensitivity` apply to mice and
touchpads; for a touchpad the rule overrides `[input.touchpad]` rather than
`[input.mouse]`. Unsupported libinput settings are reported in the log.

Rules match every attached device with the exact name. Device overrides also
apply when a device is connected after startup and when the configuration is
reloaded. Duplicate rules for the same name are rejected.

`scroll_wheel_step`, cursor settings, tablet settings, and focus settings remain
compositor-wide because they are not properties of one physical input device.

### Tablet

```toml
[input.tablet]
enabled = true                 # false disables the tablet and its pads
map_to_output = "DP-1"         # connector or monitor Config name
map_to_focused_output = false
map_to_focused_window = false  # pen area = focused window
left_handed = false
calibration_matrix = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]  # libinput calibration, 6 numbers
```

Stylus and pad input is delivered over the tablet-v2 protocol to clients that
support it (pressure, tilt, eraser as a distinct tool, pad buttons, rings, and
strips). Every other client receives pointer emulation instead: the tip acts as
the left button, `BTN_STYLUS` as the right button, and `BTN_STYLUS2` as the
middle button.

| Key                      | Type  | Default | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`                | bool  | `true`  | Silences the tablet and its pads at the libinput level. Has no effect on devices libinput cannot disable.          |
| `map_to_output`          | str   | (none)  | Confines the tablet area to the named output, using the same names as `[output.NAME]`.                             |
| `map_to_focused_output`  | bool  | `false` | Pen area follows the output holding keyboard focus.                                                                |
| `map_to_focused_window`  | bool  | `false` | Pen area tracks the focused window.                                                                                |
| `left_handed`            | bool  | `false` | Flips the tablet orientation via libinput.                                                                         |
| `calibration_matrix`     | array | (none)  | Six finite numbers passed to libinput; omitting the key restores the device default.                               |

The mapping options form a cascade. `map_to_focused_window` wins while a window
is focused; otherwise `map_to_focused_output` applies while an output holds
keyboard focus; otherwise `map_to_output` applies while that output is
connected; otherwise the pen covers the full output layout. Each level falls
through to the next when its target is unavailable, so combining options is
harmless. The tablet area is stretched to the target box without aspect-ratio
correction. `enabled`, `left_handed`, and `calibration_matrix` changes apply on
config reload, as do the mapping options for the next pen event.

### Cursor

```toml
[input.cursor]
theme = ""   # empty = environment/default Xcursor theme
size = 24    # 1-512
hardware_cursor = true
follows_focus = false
hide_when_typing = false
hide_timeout_ms = 0  # 0-3600000, 0 disables hiding
```

Set `hardware_cursor = false` to composite the cursor in the output render pass.
This can work around cursor flicker or disappearance caused by hardware cursor
planes. Cursor settings apply on config reload. Output scale changes also reload
the cursor image at the matching scale without requiring a restart.
Set `hide_when_typing = true` to hide the cursor after a non-modifier key
press. Modifier-only presses leave it visible. Typing while a pointer button is
held also leaves it visible so active clicks, drags, and game actions are not
interrupted.
Set `hide_timeout_ms` to a value from `1` to `3600000` to hide the cursor after
that many milliseconds without pointer activity. Motion, clicks, scrolling,
and tablet input reveal the cursor and restart the timeout. The two hiding
options can be enabled together.

Set `follows_focus = true` to warp the cursor to the visible center of a window
selected by directional window focus, next-window focus, floating-state focus,
or first/last-column focus navigation. It also follows the focused window after
an in-workspace `window-move-or-output-*` move, an output focus action, a window
or column move to another workspace or output, and a foreign-toplevel
activation request from a dock or taskbar. This applies whether the matching
action comes from a keybind, wheel bind, or IPC. Pointer-driven focus, automatic
focus after a window closes, gestures, and overview selection do not warp the
cursor. `window-focus:<id>` remains focus-only; use
`window-focus-warp:<id>` when an individual id-based request must always move
the cursor.

### Focus

```toml
[input.focus]
follows_mouse = false
follows_mouse_max_scroll = 0.5  # optional, measured in viewport widths
```

| Key                        | Type  | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `follows_mouse`            | bool  | `false`    | Focus the pointer target on enter, after compositor focus changes reveal another target, and after client drag completion.                                                      |
| `follows_mouse_max_scroll` | float | (no limit) | Do not change focus when revealing the window would scroll farther than this many viewport widths. `0.0` allows only windows that are already fully visible. Omit for no limit. |

Mapping windows and switching workspaces can change which window is under a
stationary pointer. The existing focus remains until the next pointer motion,
which selects the window under the pointer without requiring a border crossing.
Finishing a client data drag performs the same refresh at the unchanged cursor
position, so dropping over another window selects it immediately.

For example, a window three screens away requires a limit of at least `3.0`.
Values outside `0.0` to `100.0` are clamped and reported.
